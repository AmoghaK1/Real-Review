# Legacy MongoDB Files

This folder contains MongoDB-related scripts that are no longer used in the application.

The application has been migrated from MongoDB to DynamoDB for better scalability and performance.

## Files:
- `syncS3andMongo.js` - Previously used to sync S3 with MongoDB
- `syncMongoToDynamo.js` - Migration script used to move data from MongoDB to DynamoDB

These files are kept for historical reference but are not part of the active codebase.
